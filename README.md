# MUSE.
MUSE — an AI art explorer built with React, Tailwind, and the OpenAI API. Generate, view, and save creative artworks through simple prompts, all within a clean Replit-based interface.

## Description

**MUSE** is an intelligent AI-driven art discovery and exploration web application designed to transform how users interact with visual media. It empowers users to **upload or preview artworks**, analyze them through AI, and receive **instant contextual insights** about the piece — such as its theme, style, or historical significance.

Using advanced **image recognition APIs** and **AI-driven recommendation models**, MUSE identifies the artwork or image content and presents **visually and thematically similar pieces** from its growing dataset. The experience feels intuitive, immersive, and personalized.

In addition to visual exploration, MUSE integrates an **AI chatbot** that acts as your personal digital curator. You can ask questions like:

* “Who painted this artwork?”
* “What style is this image inspired by?”
* “Can you show me similar digital artworks?”

The chatbot offers real-time, context-aware responses, providing both educational insight and creative inspiration.
